  "body": "### Welcome to SIEMME 2016\r\nSIEMME 2016, also _the 22th China-Japan Bilateral Symposium on Intelligent Electrophotonic Materials and Molecular Electronics_, is about to be held in Suzhou on September 22-24, 2016. [Southeast University](http://www.seu.edu.cn) (China) and [Tokyo University of Science](http://www.tus.ac.jp) (Japan) will organize the symposium together.  \r\n+ 220+ attendees\r\n+ 5 plenary talks\r\n+ 36 invited talks\r\n+ 50 oral talks\r\n+ 100+ posters\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.",
